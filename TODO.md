# Plan to replace org-roam with something of my own
I feel more and more like I want to replace org-roam with something of my own

## TODO
- Strip out links that are private if it makes sense
- Should not use os.Args directly anywhere except main. A copy of it should be in state. Because testing coming up
- Add a migration check

- If still empty all of this
- Look over all code and make a list of things to do

### Cleanup
- Find
- Create

### Misc
- Lint
- Tests
