# Readme

This is a cli clone of org-roam.

## Templates 
This will most likely change in a incompatible way at some point in the future. Currently just a bare minimum thingy so I can start using this

They should be placed in your ROAM-DIR/.config/templates

Currently supported variables:
- $$TIME$$
- $$DATE$$
- $$DATETIME$$
- $$TITLE$$
