* Plan to replace org-roam with something of my own
I feel more and more like I want to replace org-roam with something of my own

** Features
- Publish support; with a golang template for UI (use something like the index builder thing I made)
- Create template
- Edit template
- Upgrade: migrates config

** Later
- Interactive mode that will give you a dropdown of options to replace it with and edit file option
- Find a way to tell the user there are problems they should deal with
- Full lint. Started but had some issues
- Move all models to models

** v0.0.15
- Use a really simple template system like with the notes
- Add a flat index page
*** Plan
1. Make something that returns folder path and filename based on the bath: example a/b/c/d.html -> a/b/c, d.html
2. Create folders and write markdown


** v0.0.16
- Replace the internal links with real links
- Add backlinks

** v0.0.17
- Nested index links

** v0.0.18
- Don't include private
- Option to include it



** Script to move from org til md
find . -name "*.org" -print0 | while read -d $'\0' file
do
    echo "$file"
    pandoc "$file" -s -o "${file/.org/.md}"
    rm "$file"
done
